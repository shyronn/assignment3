        <h2>Day One. July 8, 1992</h2>

        <p><strong>New York, NY.</strong></p> 
        <p>Six NYU professors went in search for the best set of headphones they could find for the department’s new recording studio—but when they couldn’t find what they were looking for, they decided to embark on a new side project: creating the best headphones the music market has ever seen. The side job quickly commanded all of their attention, and <em>Box Headphones</em> was soon born.</p>
