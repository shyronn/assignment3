        <h2>Day One. July 8, 1992</h2>

        <p><strong>New York, NY.</strong></p> 
        <p>6 NYU professors went in search for the best set of headphones for the department’s new recording studio, but when they couldn’t find what they were looking for, they decided to embark on a new side project: to create the best headphones the music market has ever seen. The side job quickly commanded all of their attention, and Box Headphones was born.</p>
